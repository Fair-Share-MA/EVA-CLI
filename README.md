## Usage:

1. Install python version 3.9.x
2. Create folders named `input` and `output` at the same level as the `src` directory
3. Move all excel or csv files to be processed into the `input` directory. You may also use a previously generated `export.csv` file as an input to build on the previous dataset
4. Run the script with `python main.py` from within the src folder.
5. Wait for export to complete. You should see `export.csv` in the output folder.
